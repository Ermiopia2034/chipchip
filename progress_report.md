Task Completed: Milestone 1 - Foundation & Environment Setup

Summary of Changes:
- Initialized project in current directory as root.
- Added project structure: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `data/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`.
- Backend: Created FastAPI skeleton with `/health` endpoint (`backend/app/main.py`), configuration stub (`backend/app/config.py`), `requirements.txt`, and Dockerfile.
- Frontend: Scaffolded Next.js 14 (App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind) via CLI; added `socket.io-client`, `@headlessui/react`, and `lucide-react`; added Dockerfile.
- Docker Compose: Added 5 services (frontend, backend, postgres, redis, chroma) with health checks, volumes, and restart policies; configured host port offset (+5) to avoid conflicts.
- Environment: Added `.env.example` with required variables and note on host port offset.
- Documentation: Added `README.md` with quick start and port offset note.

Notes:
- Host ports are offset by +5 (e.g., frontend 3005, backend 8005, postgres 5437, redis 6384, chroma 8006); container/internal ports remain defaults for inter-service communication.

Next Steps:
- Milestone 2: Implement PostgreSQL schema and data loading scripts (`backend/scripts/init_db.py`, `backend/scripts/load_dataset.py`), and set up Chroma initialization service. Validate via Docker Compose exec commands per implementation plan.
 
Date: 2025-10-19

Task Completed: Milestone 2 - Data Layer Implementation

Summary of Changes:
- Database: Schema initialized per plan (users, products, inventory, orders, order_items, competitor_pricing, transaction_history). Postgres already ingested with synthetic dataset (confirmed operational state).
- RAG/Chroma: Ingested product knowledge base into Chroma; collection `product_knowledge` now has 57 documents. Verified semantic search with strong matches for storage-related queries.
- KB Improvement: Added `Apple,storage` entry to `data/product_knowledge_base.csv` to improve "keep apples fresh" retrieval; re-ingested successfully.
- Documentation: Added `project_knowledge.md` explaining RAG architecture, model (Google text-embedding-004), ingestion, and test commands.

Commands Executed:
- `docker compose up -d chroma backend`
- `docker compose exec backend python -c "from scripts.load_dataset import ingest_knowledge_base; ingest_knowledge_base('/data/product_knowledge_base.csv')"`
- Validation: counted docs and ran sample searches via inline Python using `VectorDBService`.

Notes:
- RAG embeddings (Chroma) call the Generative Language v1 API using an API key header; either `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` works for embeddings. Use an AI Studio API key. If IP restrictions are enabled, allow the host/server egress IP.
- Backend startup is fail-fast without `GEMINI_API_KEY` because LLM/Image services depend on it. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` even if `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is present for embeddings.

Next Steps:
- Begin Milestone 3 (Backend Core Services):
  - Implement `backend/app/services/db_service.py` with async SQLAlchemy engine, ORM models, and CRUD operations as specified in the implementation plan.
  - Enhance `backend/app/config.py` with validations and fail-fast checks for required env vars.
  - Add unit/integration tests for DB service (where feasible) and wire initial usage where needed.

Date: 2025-10-19

Task Completed: Milestone 3 - Backend Core Services (Core Implementation)

Summary of Changes:
- Config: Added validation and fail-fast startup checks (`backend/app/config.py`, `backend/app/main.py`).
- ORM Models: Implemented SQLAlchemy models aligned with schema (`backend/app/models/orm.py`).
- DB Service: Added async SQLAlchemy engine and comprehensive operations (`backend/app/services/db_service.py`).
- Exceptions: Added typed exceptions for DB layer (`backend/app/services/exceptions.py`).
- LLM Service: Implemented Gemini client with 8 tool declarations and response parsing (`backend/app/services/llm_service.py`), plus system prompt (`backend/app/prompts/system_prompt.py`).
- RAG Service: Refined to use configurable top-K and added async wrapper (`backend/app/services/rag_service.py`).
- Image Service: Implemented with Gemini attempt + placeholder fallback and local static storage (`backend/app/services/image_service.py`).
- Session Manager: Added Redis-backed session operations (`backend/app/orchestrator/session_manager.py`).
- Tests: Added minimal smoke tests for services (`backend/tests/...`).
- Dependencies: Added `asyncpg` for async DB driver (`backend/requirements.txt`).

Next Steps:
- Milestone 4: Conversation Orchestration & Tool Registry
  - Implement `app/orchestrator/tool_registry.py`, `intent_detector.py`, and `conversation.py` per implementation plan.
  - Wire services into orchestrator flows and add targeted integration tests.

Date: 2025-10-19

Task Completed: Milestone 3 - Unit Tests and Finalization

Summary of Changes:
- Image Service: Fixed static path to be repo-relative; avoids CWD issues (`backend/app/services/image_service.py`).
- Tests: Added LLM and Image service unit tests; made RAG import test conditional; added `conftest.py` to expose `backend` on `sys.path`; registered `asyncio` mark via `pytest.ini`.
  - Files: `backend/tests/services/test_llm_service.py`, `backend/tests/services/test_image_service.py`, `backend/tests/services/test_rag_service.py`, `backend/tests/conftest.py`, `pytest.ini`.
- Validation: Ran `pytest`; results: 4 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failures.

Next Steps:
- Begin Milestone 4 implementation as previously outlined: Tool Registry, Intent Detector, Conversation Orchestrator, and integration tests.

Date: 2025-10-19

Task Completed: Milestone 3 - Container Test Execution

Summary of Changes:
- Enabled RAG semantic search test to run conditionally; auto-ingests KB if needed (`backend/tests/services/test_rag_service.py`).
- Executed backend test suite inside container: `docker exec chipchip-backend-1 pytest -vv`.
- Result: 8 passed, 0 skipped (RAG tests ran against running Chroma with configured GEMINI_API_KEY).

Next Steps:
- Proceed to Milestone 4: implement Tool Registry, Intent Detector, and Conversation Orchestrator per plan and add integration tests.

Date: 2025-10-19

Task Completed: Milestone 4 - Orchestration Core Implementation

Summary of Changes:
- Added Conversation State Machine (`backend/app/models/state_machine.py`).
- Implemented Tool Registry with 8 handlers (`backend/app/orchestrator/tool_registry.py`) covering search, pricing insights, RAG query, order creation, inventory ops, schedule, and flash sale suggestions.
- Implemented LLM-only Intent Detector using `models/gemini-flash-latest` (`backend/app/orchestrator/intent_detector.py`). No rule fallbacks.
- Implemented Conversation Orchestrator with function-calling loop, registration handling, and session updates (`backend/app/orchestrator/conversation.py`).
- Added real-data tests (no mocks) for intent detection, tool registry, and orchestrator (`backend/tests/orchestrator/...`). Tests are designed to run inside Docker with live services and `GEMINI_API_KEY` set.

Notes:
- Intent detection exclusively uses Gemini Flash (fast) as requested.
- Tool handlers rely on existing DB, Redis, and Chroma data. Inventory-dependent flows in tests create supplier inventory via the tool before asserting.

How to Run Tests in Docker (execute these yourself):
- Start services: `docker compose up -d postgres redis chroma backend`
- Ensure `.env` has `GEMINI_API_KEY` and data is loaded per Milestone 2.
- Run tests inside backend container (container root is `/app`):
  - `docker compose exec backend pytest -vv tests/orchestrator`
  - Or full suite: `docker compose exec backend pytest -vv`

Additional Notes for Next Milestones:
- Gemini tools are declared using the SDK Schema with `type_` (ENUM values: OBJECT, STRING, NUMBER, BOOLEAN) and wrapped as `tools=[{"function_declarations": [...] }]`. Messages passed to `generate_content` are `{role, parts: [text]}`. Keep this shape when integrating in WebSocket flows.
- ORM now sets `users.user_id` with `server_default=uuid_generate_v4()`; `scripts/init_db.py` already enables `uuid-ossp`. Ensure DB is initialized before running orchestrator flows.
- Orchestrator tests are idempotent: they reuse an existing supplier user if present. You may set `TEST_SUPPLIER_PHONE` in `.env` to force a stable test supplier.

Next Steps:
- Milestone 4 - Finalization: refine orchestrator prompts and add a few more integration tests for order flow (customer side) and schedule listing (supplier side).

Date: 2025-10-19

Task Completed: Milestone 4 - Finalization

Summary of Changes:
- Prompt: Refined bilingual guidance and tool usage policy in `backend/app/prompts/system_prompt.py` to always use English for internal tool calls/semantic search and reply in the user’s input language. Added confirmation rules and clarity guidelines.
- Tests (real-data):
  - Customer order flow using Tool Registry with live DB: `backend/tests/orchestrator/test_conversation_order_flow_real.py`.
  - Supplier schedule listing with confirmed orders: `backend/tests/orchestrator/test_supplier_schedule_real.py`.
- Resilience: Added unit test to cover single tool-call follow-up finalization in the orchestrator: `backend/tests/orchestrator/test_conversation_followup_unit.py`.

How to Run (inside Docker):
- Ensure services and data are ready: `docker compose up -d postgres redis chroma backend` and load datasets per Milestone 2.
- Run orchestrator tests: `docker compose exec backend pytest -vv tests/orchestrator`.

Next Steps:
- Begin Milestone 5: Frontend Implementation and WebSocket/Socket.IO plumbing per implementation plan (chat UI, socket client/store, backend socket endpoint and session REST endpoints).

Date: 2025-10-19

Task Completed: Milestone 5 - Backend Realtime & Sessions (Part 1)

Summary of Changes:
- Added REST session endpoints: `POST /api/sessions` (create), `GET /api/sessions/{id}` (fetch) in `backend/app/main.py`.
- Mounted static at `/static` to serve generated images from `backend/app/static/`.
- Enabled CORS for frontend origin `http://localhost:3005`.
- Implemented Socket.IO server mounted at `/socket.io` with events: `connect`, `message` (invokes orchestrator), `response`, `typing`, `disconnect`.
- Added plain WebSocket fallback at `/ws/{session_id}` for basic text exchange.

Next Steps:
- Milestone 5 (Part 2): Implement frontend chat UI and real-time client; wire to new endpoints.

Date: 2025-10-19

Task Completed: Milestone 5 - Frontend Chat UI & Client (Part 2)

Summary of Changes:
- Created chat route `frontend/app/chat/page.tsx` with `ChatProvider`, message list, input, typing indicator, and language selector.
- Implemented Socket.IO client (`frontend/lib/socketClient.ts`) and chat store/context (`frontend/lib/chatStore.tsx`) with reconnect, session bootstrap via REST, and message queue basics.
- Added UI components: `ChatMessage.tsx`, `ChatInput.tsx`, `TypingIndicator.tsx`, `OrderCard.tsx`, `LanguageSelector.tsx`.
- Updated landing page to include a "Start Chat" button linking to `/chat`.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to expose `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8005` to the browser.

Next Steps:
- Manual E2E validation: start compose, create session, exchange messages, verify typing indicator and persistence.
- Polish UI (spacing, mobile tweaks) if needed and document usage in README.

Date: 2025-10-19

Task Completed: Milestone 6 - Monitoring & Logging (Partial)

Summary of Changes:
- Added centralized logging configuration with `LOG_LEVEL` env and stdout handler (`backend/app/config.py: setup_logging`).
- Added trace logs for LLM calls, tool invocations/results, intents, and Socket.IO message events (`backend/app/services/llm_service.py`, `backend/app/orchestrator/{conversation.py,tool_registry.py}`, `backend/app/main.py`).
- Enabled optional SQL echo via `DB_ECHO` env (wired into async engine creation in `backend/app/services/db_service.py`).
- Introduced `TRACE_TOOLS` env to toggle detailed tool input/output logging.

How to View Logs:
- Set in `.env`: `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and optionally `TRACE_TOOLS=1`, `DB_ECHO=1`.
- Restart backend: `docker compose up -d backend`.
- Tail logs: `docker compose logs -f backend`.

Next Steps:
- Optionally switch to JSON-formatted logs and add request IDs for full correlation.

Date: 2025-10-20

Task Completed: Milestone 6 - Integration Tests, Load Test, Data Validation, JSON Logging

Summary of Changes:
- Integration Tests: Added end-to-end chat + tool flows (`backend/tests/integration/test_flows.py`) covering customer registration → RAG query → order, supplier registration → pricing insights → inventory with image gen, flash-sale suggestion, and multi-language exchanges.
- Load Test: Added lightweight concurrent session test (`backend/tests/load/load_test.py`) with env overrides `LOAD_SESSIONS` and `LOAD_MSGS` to probe latency percentiles.
- Data Validation: Implemented `backend/scripts/validate_data.py` to verify row counts, orphaned references, historical date sanity, and Chroma collection size vs CSV.
- Monitoring & Logging: Enabled optional JSON log output via `LOG_JSON=1` (`backend/app/config.py: setup_logging`).
- Documentation: Updated `README.md` with instructions to run integration/load tests, data validation, and logging toggles.

How to Run:
- Integration: `docker compose exec backend pytest -vv tests/integration`
- Load: `docker compose exec -e LOAD_SESSIONS=10 -e LOAD_MSGS=10 backend pytest -q tests/load`
- Data validation: `docker compose exec backend python scripts/validate_data.py`

Notes:
- Tests that require external services are skipped if `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not set or if DB/Chroma are not reachable; with the current environment keys/data, they run against real services (no mocks).

Next Steps:
- Proceed with remaining Milestone 6 items when ready: production container hardening (`docker-compose.prod.yml`, multi-stage Dockerfiles) and security hardening (rate limiting, CSP guidance). We held these per request.

Date: 2025-10-20

Task Completed: Milestone 6 - Production Docker (MVP)

Summary of Changes:
- Backend Dockerfile: Removed dev reload, added healthcheck, ensured non-buffered output (`backend/Dockerfile`).
- Frontend Dockerfile: Multi-stage build with `npm ci`, `npm run build`, and `npm run start` (`frontend/Dockerfile`).
- Production Compose: Added `docker-compose.prod.yml` with services (frontend, backend, postgres, redis, chroma), named volumes, and port mapping (frontend 3000, backend 8000). Frontend build accepts `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` for browser calls to backend. Backend persists generated images to `backend_static` volume.
- README: Added “Production (VPS) Run” section with clear steps.

How to Deploy:
- Set env: `export NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000` and configure `.env` (GEMINI_API_KEY).
- Start: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`.
- Initialize data (first run): `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python scripts/init_db.py` then `scripts/load_dataset.py`.

Next Steps:
- Optional polish: Add Nginx reverse proxy + TLS and tune resource limits. Security hardening remains out-of-scope per MVP request.

Date: 2025-10-20

Task Completed: Host Nginx Setup + Production Guide (Updated)

Summary of Changes:
- Removed containerized Nginx; adjusted production compose to expose frontend on host 3005 and backend on host 8005 (`docker-compose.prod.yml`).
- Deleted Docker Nginx config (`deploy/nginx/nginx.conf`).
- Updated `production_guide.md` to use host-level Nginx at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/chipchip` proxying to 127.0.0.1:3005 (frontend) and 127.0.0.1:8005 (backend `/api`, `/socket.io`, `/static`).
- Updated `README.md` Production section accordingly.

How to Use:
- Set in `.env`: `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://chipchip.ermiopia.com`.
- Start services: `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build`.
- Configure host Nginx (sites-available/sites-enabled), test, and reload; see `production_guide.md`.

Next Steps:
- Optional: enable TLS via certbot and update the host Nginx site for 443.

Date: 2025-10-20

Task Completed: Frontend UI Polish — Landing + Chat

Summary of Changes:
- Landing Page: Replaced default Next.js template with a branded, animated landing page featuring hero gradient, glassmorphism, and feature cards (frontend/app/page.tsx). Added subtle background gradients and grid depth (frontend/app/globals.css).
- Chat Page: Restyled chat with a glass container, status header, and improved layout (frontend/app/chat/page.tsx). Enhanced message bubbles with avatars, gradients, and mount animations (frontend/components/ChatMessage.tsx). Upgraded input bar with pill style, send icon, and enter/shift+enter hints (frontend/components/ChatInput.tsx). Polished typing indicator and language selector (frontend/components/TypingIndicator.tsx, frontend/components/LanguageSelector.tsx).
- Metadata: Updated site title/description (frontend/app/layout.tsx). No new dependencies added.

Next Steps:
- Optional enhancements: markdown rendering in assistant messages, scroll-to-bottom affordance, additional responsive tweaks, and theme toggle. Validate visuals across mobile/desktop.
